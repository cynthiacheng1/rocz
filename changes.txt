There were no significant changes from the original design.
We did add a template to spruce up the CSS of the website, however the instructions of the design doc stayed pretty stagnant.
We all had experience working with databases and websites, therefore knew previous techniques we knew would work. Editing was not necessary in the creation of our website. 
The jobs tended to bleed into one another; many of us worked on aspects that were not assigned to us.
